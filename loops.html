                Loops are how we quickly go through a lot of data, whether it be lists or
                collections or lists of collections. We use loops because it is convienient
                and in part because we are lazy. Ok, that's not quite true it's not that we
                are lazy per se but the things is lists can get so big they can contains
                billions or trillions of items. Searching through a large list manually
                somewhat defeats the purpose of writing a program in the first place. so we
                automate the process.
            </p>
            <h3>Cool beans.</h3>
            <p>
                Those beans are cool, I agree.
            </p>
            <h3>So why are there so many of them?</h3>
            <p>
                Well it turns out that we don't want to loop through all data the same way
                because the goal is not always the same. So for that reason we have
                different loops for different situations. So the big four or "Fab Four"
                as I and no one else calls them are:
            </p>
            <h4>For loop</h4>
            <p>
                This loop uses an int and increases it every time it completes the body of
                code found inside. Every time it complete that body of code it compares the
                int to the break condition if the break condition is met, the loop stops or
                else it increments the int(or decreases if you're feeling feisty) and
                completes the body of code again. This repeats until the break condition is
                met.
            </p>
            <h4>Foreach loop</h4>
            <p>
                This loop goes through every item in the list once. It's only break condition
                is reaching the ennd of the list. It doesn't stop in the middle and it doesn't
                repeat itself. This loop is the tough guy in the group. It's a closer and it
                doesn't mess around.
            </p>
            <h4>While loop</h4>
            <p>
                The genius loop. Simple to understand but robust in it's application. This loop
                can use many different conditions as it's break condition. If you want you can
                make the break condition a boolean. You can also decide once a certain number
                is reached or if a string that says a certain passphrase is found. However
                be careful, if you forget to put a way for the loop to break in the body of
                the loop it could go on for as long as your computer is running.
            </p>
            <h4>Do while</h4>
            <p>
                A while loop but guarantees that the body will run at least once. Not much else
                to say.
