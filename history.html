            <p>
                C# is a medium level, strongly typed, object oriented language developed by Microsoft
                at the turn of the century. Leading the team was Anders Hejlsberg who took a lot of what
                made Java great, most notably the Java Virtual Machine and improved upon some of the
                other design elements that had become dated. As both languages developed further they
                branched in different directions as each company better defined their visions for
                their respective languages.
            </p>
            <p>
                C# is a language specifically designed to take advantage of the .NET framework; a robust
                collection of libraries with wide-ranging uses.

            <h1>Why C#?</h1>
            <p>
                C# syntax is very easy to read which makes it ideal for beginners. It is also one of the
                most widely used languages in the world with a wide range of versitility. ASP.NET
                framework is only second to PHP for backend web development. It is also the standard language
                for development in the Unity game engine which is becoming increasingly popular amonst developers.
                And with Microsofts procurement of Xamarin C# has also become an excellent language for developers
                in the mobile arena.
