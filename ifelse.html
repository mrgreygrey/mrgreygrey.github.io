                    No my good friend, it's a promise. It is a promise that if
                    certain conditions are met, certain things will happen. that
                    can be good or bad but it's up to you do decide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If else is the most common way to validate something in your
                    code. It is so incredibly useful you will most likely never
                    see a programming language that does not use it. In fact the
                    syntax is even incredibly similar between most languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The basic idea is this: If the condition is true, complete
                    this body of code; if it is not, complete this othe body of
                    code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at the above example you can see a few things. first
                    is that the method has a parameter. A double that seems to
                    be how much money was offered. Second is that there is a
                    variable which is the minimum amount of money we would accept.
                    What are we selling? It's private, I don't want to talk about
                    it. The third thing you will see is that in the brackets for
                    the if statement is that we are comparing them to each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal here is to determine if our conditions are met. In
                    this case we are asking if the offered money is more than or
                    equal to the amount we are willing to accept. If that happens
                    to be true we then return a string saying we agree to the
                    offer. If it's not true we then get a bit snarky when we
                    demand more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If else can also test to see if booleans are true or false,
                    they can compare strings to see if they contain the same
                    value or even to test to see if entire objects are identical.
                    They are a critical tool in your coding tool chest and have
                    a ton of uses. They are incredibly intuitive statements and
                    very easy to learn and master.
