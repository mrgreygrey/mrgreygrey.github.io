                Haha no no I/O not Io. I/O is short for input/output. It is one
                of the most critical function that computers perform. Without it
                they are effectively useless. It how information is passed and
                the "information" part of information technology.

            <h3>Cool let's do it!</h3>
            <p>
                Lucky for us we can easily read and write to a console with our
                two primary commands: <br>
                Cosole.WriteLine() which is used for the program to the console. <br>
                Console.ReadLine() which will read what the user types into the
                console.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you look at the above example the program will write a request
                to the user to enter their age. Then the program will wait for
                the user to enter their age and assign it to a string. Finally it
                will write to the console the age the user input. It is important
                to note that the program shown above does not do any sort of
                verification to ensure that the users input is actually a number
                this is obviously a terrible practice because the user could
                have put "potato" and the program would have wrote "you are
                potato years old". That is less than ideal. Remember whenever you
                right code to validate all data so that these things don't happen.
            </p>
            <h3>Thats it?</h3>
            <p>
                For reading and writing to console it really is that easy! However
                These methods are far more robust than that. Console.Read() can
                actually take a file as a parameter and read the file which you can
                then manipulate however you want.
